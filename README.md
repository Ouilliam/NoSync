# NoSync

NoSync is a small personal script that I use to synchronize my calendars (Notion and Google Calendar). The queries done in here are related to how I manage my Notion workspace which means it will surely not work on yours (I just want to share it in case it can help people!).

The script includes a little Notion client to perform the basic queries to the API.
